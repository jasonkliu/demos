Demos is dedicated to educating local elementary students in the basic sciences
while showing that science is both fun and accessible. We offer four separate programs.

Weekly Classroom Program
------------------------

The weekly classroom program is an interactive learning laboratory, designed to engage 
students in hands-on activities. By promoting this sort of experimentation and guiding
in-class discussions, Demos volunteers work to spark students' interest in science and
help them through the basic principles that underlie our experiments. Volunteers spend
an hour a week teaching in a New Haven elementary classroom, giving them a chance to
develop a working rapport with their students.  

The curriculum is designed foremost to be interactive and to cover a variety of subject
areas. It is not intended to be complete or comprehensive by any means, rather we design
our curriculum with the purpose of giving students opportunities for exploration and
experimentation that they might not have in the standard New Haven curriculum. We ensure
that each of our hour-long modules meets Connecticut curriculum standards for grades 2-6.
			
Assemblies
----------

Demos Assemblies presents 45-minute assemblies to gymnasiums full of elementary
school students. We use everything from liquid nitrogen, dry ice and some pretty
crazy chemicals to frozen bananas, flowers and diapers in our thrilling show.
The subject of the show is "States of Matter and Chemical Reactions", and the
presentation is designed to be interactive and educational. Loved by students
and teachers alike, it's a time-tested show that has been running successfully
for more than 6 years across Illinois and Connecticut. Physics Nobel laureate
Leon Lederman called it "proof that learning science is fabulous fun!" Our
program is well suited for students in all grades K-5. (The assembly covers
material in the Connecticut science curriculum standards for grades 2-3.)  

Most importantly, however, students learn that anyone can be a scientist:
whenever you wonder about _stuff_, you're doing science.  For more information,

StarLab
-------

Teach kids about astronomy with the Starlab Planetarium! You and a partner will
visit New Haven elementary schools with a blow-up planetarium inside which you
will teach students about constellations, Greek mythology, planets, comets, star
formations, and more to deepen the students' understanding of our universe. The
igloo-shaped planetarium inflates to a height of almost 11 feet and can
accommodate some twenty kids plus you and the state-of-the-art night sky
projector.  

All levels of expertise are welcome. For more information, contact
