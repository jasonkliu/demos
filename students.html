          <h2>Weekly Classroom Program</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">The weekly classroom program is by far our most popular program with Yale students. Two- or three-person teams are matched with a classroom in a New Haven local elementary school. The teams visit once weekly to present a hands-on science activity to their students. Each week you'll pick up a bag of supplies from the Demos closet in Dwight Hall on Old Campus and travel to and from your school.</p>
			<ul> <li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Time commitment: One hour per week including travel (we will find a time which fits your schedule).<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Volunteers are expected to be able to commit every week or, let their classroom know beforehand if they have an emergency and are not available a certain week.<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Volunteers may chose their partners - perhaps a friend or roommate - or have them assigned.<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Training: Minimal. Required meeting (20 minute maximum) for all new volunteers before the first classroom visits.<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">All volunteers will receive a binder as well as a stylish Demos t-shirt.<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Not a science major? Don't worry! This is fun, <em>elementary school</em> science. We make lava lamps, silly putty, and ice cream. It's a blast for everyone who loves fun and children!<br>
			</ul>

          <h2>Assemblies</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Demos Assemblies presents assemblies to gymnasiums full of elementary school students. We use everything from liquid nitrogen, dry ice and some pretty crazy chemicals to frozen bananas, flowers, and diapers in our thrilling show. Our demos are very large scale - we've been known to leave soap on gymnasium ceilings - but they're all easy to learn, and an incredible amount of fun to present.</p>
			<ul> <li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Time commitment: About 2 hours per assembly roughly every 3 months.<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Generally, Assemblies occur on Friday afternoons due to volunteers' schedules, but other days of the week are open according to availability of volunteers.<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Volunteers are not necessarily expected to be at every assembly, as in the weekly classroom program.<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Visits a variety of different schools for each show.<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Training: Minimal. The coordinators will communicate with you, go over the script, and help the volunteers become acquainted with the materials (30 minute maximum before the show).<br>
			</ul>
			<p> </p>

		<div class="span12">
          <h2>StarLab</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Demos is the proud owner of a travelling, inflatable planetarium. You will teach about constellations, Greek mythology, planets, comets, star formations, and more to deepen the students' understanding of our universe.</p>
			<ul> <li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Time commitment: About 2.5 hours per show.<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Generally, StarLab occurs on Friday afternoons due to volunteers' schedules, but other days of the week are open according to availability of volunteers.<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Volunteers are not necessarily expected to be at every StarLab show, as in the weekly classroom program.<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Visits a variety of different schools for each show.<br>
			<li><p style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Training: Required meeting in which the coordinators teach the essentials of using the state-of-the-art night sky projector (45 minute maximum before the show).<br>
			</ul>
