  <h3>Maria Quinonez</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Maria grew up in LA, California. She loves science so much she initially planned to go to medical
      school and be a neuroscientist. Her interests have shifted somewhat -she is now doing social science
      in psychology rather than any real STEM- but she still loves sharing science.

StarLab Coordinators
--------------------
<div id="accordion4">
  <h3>David Minoli</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Hello there stranger!  Hopefully, if you're reading this, we won't be strangers for long - my name
      is David Minoli, and I'm a StarLab coordinator, as well as a regular demos classroom teacher.  I'm
      currently a junior in Calhoun college, studying Chemistry and planning to go into Dentistry.  While
      this does mean I'm a stickler for oral hygiene and I love spectroscopy a little too much, I focus a
      lot of my time on extracurricular and leisurely pursuits, such as birdwatching, cooking, swimming
      and traveling back to my home country, Italy, whenever I get the chance.  When I'm leading a
      Starlabs session, I focus less on a single-sided lecturing, and more of a freeform discussion, as it
      helps kids (and adults) actually learn what they want to know.  As for teaching in the classroom, I
      particularly enjoy doing chemistry experiments, since I believe that there's no better way of
      learning science than hands-on experience.  
      
      Please do contact me at david.minoli@yale.edu with any questions, concerns, or even just to chat - I'm always available.
