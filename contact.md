- [Maria Quinonez](mailto:maria.quinonez@yale.edu)  
   Maria grew up in LA, California. She loves science so much she initially planned to go to medical
   school and be a neuroscientist. Her interests have shifted somewhat -she is now doing social science
   in psychology rather than any real STEM- but she still loves sharing science.  
&nbsp;

- [Alice Zhang](mailto:alice.zhang@yale.edu)  
   Alice Zhang, a sophomore in Calhoun College, is planning to major in Molecular,
   Cellular, and Developmental Biology. Outside of spreading love for the
   sciences, she plays the saxophone in the Davenport Pops Orchestra, conducts
   research at the Yale Stem Cell Center, and is involved in the Womenâ€™s
   Leadership Initiative and Greek life. She loves running in the great outdoors;
   eating mangoes, sushi, and froyo; and traveling the world (she saw the Pope
   this past summer)!

   Originally hailing from Atlanta, GA, Wendy is a Hounie in the Class of 2017
   with a love for music, reading, cooking, TV shows, origami, cooking, coffee,
   random facts, and a bunch of random other things...  She is a prospective
   biomedical engineering major with a variety of extracurricular interests.
   Outside of Demos, Wendy is involved with community outreach, cultural groups,
   Danceworks, and Greek life.  She is excited to share her love for science with
   younger students!

   East Rock and strolling through the Yale University Art Gallery.  

StarLab Coordinators
--------------------
- [David Minoli](mailto:david.minoli@yale.edu)  
   Hello there stranger!  Hopefully, if you're reading this, we won't be strangers for long - my name
   is David Minoli, and I'm a StarLab coordinator, as well as a regular demos classroom teacher.  I'm
   currently a junior in Calhoun college, studying Chemistry and planning to go into Dentistry.  While
   this does mean I'm a stickler for oral hygiene and I love spectroscopy a little too much, I focus a
   lot of my time on extracurricular and leisurely pursuits, such as birdwatching, cooking, swimming
   and traveling back to my home country, Italy, whenever I get the chance.  When I'm leading a
   Starlabs session, I focus less on a single-sided lecturing, and more of a freeform discussion, as it
   helps kids (and adults) actually learn what they want to know.  As for teaching in the classroom, I
   particularly enjoy doing chemistry experiments, since I believe that there's no better way of
   learning science than hands-on experience.  
&nbsp;

- [Kathleen Yu](mailto:kathleen.yu@yale.edu)  
   Kathleen is a sophomore in Pierson College majoring in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry.
   Outside of volunteering for DEMOS, she is involved with Yale Science Olympiad, Undergraduate Women
   in Science at Yale, and research at the Yale School of Medicine. In her free time, Kathleen loves to
   cook and follow food blogs.
