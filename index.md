Demos, an undergraduate volunteer organization at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/) 
in [New Haven, Connecticut](http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/), is dedicated to educating local
elementary students in the basic sciences while showing that science is both fun
and accessible. We have a [long history](/demos/about/) in the New Haven and
Yale communities and are proud to be one of Yale's most respected educational
organizations.  We offer a wide variety of [programs](/demos/programs/). In
fact, during the late '80s and early '90s local school standards did not mandate
that science be taught in elementary schools, and so for nearly a decade,
thousands of New Haven elementary students were only exposed to science through
Demos.
