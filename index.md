title: "Demos: Making Science Fun!"

Demos, an undergraduate volunteer organization at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/) in
[New Haven, Connecticut](http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/), is dedicated to educating local elementary students
in the basic sciences while showing that science is both fun and accessible. We have a [long history](/demos/about/)
in the New Haven and Yale communities and are proud to be one of Yale's most respected educational organizations.
We offer a wide variety of [programs](/demos/programs/). In fact, during the late '80s and early '90s local school
standards did not mandate that science be taught in elementary schools, and so for nearly a decade, thousands of
New Haven elementary students were only exposed to science through Demos.
