  <p style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.2em;">Demos, an undergraduate volunteer organization at 
  <a href="http://www.yale.edu/">Yale University</a> in <a href="http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/">
  New Haven, Connecticut</a>, is dedicated to educating local elementary students in the basic sciences 
  while showing that science is both fun and accessible. We have a <a href="./about.html">long history</a> 
  in the New Haven and Yale communities and are proud to be one of Yale's most respected educational organizations.
  We offer a wide variety of <a href="./programs.html">programs</a>. In fact, during the late '80s and early '90s local school
  standards did not mandate that science be taught in elementary schools, and so for nearly a decade, thousands of
  New Haven elementary students were only exposed to science through Demos. </p>
