Demos is dedicated to educating local elementary students in the basic sciences
while showing that science is both fun and accessible. We offer four separate
programs.

To volunteer for Demos, take a look at our [programs](/demos/programs/) and
decide which you are interested in. More information on the commitments
necessary for each activity are listed below, along with several frequently
asked questions. Please send all requests for volunteer opportunities to
[demos@dwighthall.org](mailto:demos@dwighthall.org?subject=[DEMOS] Sign-Ups).
Both undergraduate and graduate students are welcome.

If you indicate that you're interested in our weekly classroom program, you
will be contacted by one of our school coordinators who will fit you into the
school schedule. Please note, you _must_ sign up for the weekly classroom
program at the beginning of a semester. 

If you indicate that you're interested in Assemblies, StarLab, or Tutoring, one
of the coordinators of those programs will contact you and get you involved!  

Weekly Classroom Program
------------------------

The weekly classroom program is by far our most popular program with Yale
students. Two- or three-person teams are matched with a classroom in a New
Haven local elementary school. The teams visit once weekly to present a
hands-on science activity to their students. Each week you'll pick up a bag of
supplies from the Demos closet in Dwight Hall on Old Campus and travel to and
from your school.

- Time commitment: One hour per week including travel (we will find a time
  which fits your schedule).  
- Volunteers are expected to be able to commit every week or, let their
  classroom know beforehand if they have an emergency and are not available a
  certain week.  
- Volunteers may chose their partners - perhaps a friend or roommate - or have
  them assigned.  
- Training: Minimal. Required meeting (20 minute maximum) for all new
  volunteers before the first classroom visits.  
- All volunteers will receive a binder as well as a stylish Demos t-shirt.  
- Not a science major? Don't worry! This is fun, _elementary school_ science.
  We make lava lamps, silly putty, and ice cream. It's a blast for everyone who
  loves fun and children!

Assemblies
----------

Demos Assemblies presents assemblies to gymnasiums full of elementary school
students. We use everything from liquid nitrogen, dry ice and some pretty crazy
chemicals to frozen bananas, flowers, and diapers in our thrilling show. Our
demos are very large scale - we've been known to leave soap on gymnasium
ceilings - but they're all easy to learn, and an incredible amount of fun to
present.  

- Time commitment: About 2 hours per assembly roughly every 3 months.  
- Generally, Assemblies occur on Friday afternoons due to volunteers'
  schedules, but other days of the week are open according to availability of
  volunteers.  
- Volunteers are not necessarily expected to be at every assembly, as in the
  weekly classroom program.  
- Visits a variety of different schools for each show.  
- Training: Minimal. The coordinators will communicate with you, go over the
  script, and help the volunteers become acquainted with the materials (30
  minute maximum before the show).  

StarLab
-------

Demos is the proud owner of a travelling, inflatable planetarium. You will
teach about constellations, Greek mythology, planets, comets, star formations,
and more to deepen the students' understanding of our universe.

- Time commitment: About 2.5 hours per show.
- Generally, StarLab occurs on Friday afternoons due to volunteers' schedules,
  but other days of the week are open according to availability of volunteers.  
- Volunteers are not necessarily expected to be at every StarLab show, as in
  the weekly classroom program.  
- Visits a variety of different schools for each show.  
- Training: Required meeting in which the coordinators teach the essentials of
  using the state-of-the-art night sky projector (45 minute maximum before the
  show).
